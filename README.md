# Image Processing Examples

This repository contains a growing collection of **image processing algorithms** and implementations written in Python. Each module is self-contained, well-documented, and includes both example code and explanation.

The goal is to make this repository a hands-on reference for foundational computer vision techniques such as gradients, edge detection, filtering, histograms, etc.

## Modules

| Module                      | Description                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| [`gradient_filter`](./gradient_filter)       | Apply 1D derivative filter (e.g. `[-1, 0, 1]`) to extract gradients |
| `edge_detection`           | (Planned) Canny, Sobel, Laplacian edge detectors |
| `histogram_equalization`   | (Planned) Contrast enhancement via histogram     |
| `thresholding`             | (Planned) Binary and adaptive thresholding       |
